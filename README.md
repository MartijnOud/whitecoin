Whitecoin development tree

Whitecoin is a PoS-based cryptocurrency.

Development process
===========================

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a
good thing.  Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches
if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt)
or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed
to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new
stable release versions of Whitecoin.

Feature branches are created when there are major new features being
worked on by several people.

From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and
the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will
be used to issue a warning of closure. The pull will be closed 15 days
after the warning if action is not taken by the author. Pull requests closed
in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.

Issues with no commits will be given a similar warning, and closed after
15 days from their last activity. Issues closed in this manner will be
labeled 'stale'.



Whitecoin relies on its community to provide priority of major projects and
the overall direction of the developments which are most important to them.
The Whitecoin development team are continually working on developments that
matter most to YOU the community, through our website, voting, polling and
our main bitcointalk.org thread.

Whitecoin is driven by a dedicated community of supporters yet controlled by
no one single individual. This attractive combination will help ensure stability,
growth, and compelling technological developments. People from all around the
world have worked on Whitecoin to make it secure and strong. Whitecoin exists
since early 2014.

We continue to focus on the stability, security and longevity of Whitecoin
through innovation initiatives as determined by you.  We separate ourselves
technically from other coins by enhancing our wallet, integrating services
and merchants to our blockchain, while continually improving our code.

When you decide to invest in Whitecoin, you are not investing in a get rich
quick scheme rather you are investing in the community and the values by which
we continue to make advancements towards pure greatness.

WhiteCoin for such a young coin has weathered the test of time. With its rough
 beginnings with a developer whom only cared about the money, WhiteCoin has
evolved into a driving force of energy depicted by its Logo. Today WhiteCoin
is driven by its investors, developers and the community. Currently all efforts
are on a volunteer basis with bounties being offered for key developments,
graphics and community driven initiatives. Donations have been received by
the WhiteCoin Transition Team to allot for Bounties such as Development,
Marketing, Services and Other operational expenses.
